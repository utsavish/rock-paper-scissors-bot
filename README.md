## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- A Discord bot token and permissions to run commands in your server.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/utsavish/rock-paper-scissors-bot
    cd rock-paper-scissors-bot
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Create a `.env` file or set environment variables:
    ```env
    DISCORD_TOKEN=<your-discord-bot-token>
    PREFIX=!
    ```
4. Run the bot locally:
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

## Usage
- In your Discord server, type:
  ```
  !rps rock
  !rps paper
  !rps scissors
  ```
- The bot will respond with its choice and the outcome (win/lose/tie).

## Game Logic (via `game.js`)
The game mechanics typically follow this approach:
1. Validate user input: ensure it's `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
2. Randomly select the bot's choice.
3. Compare choices; respond with:
   - Tie (both choices equal),
   - User win,
   - Bot win.

## Deployment
- This bot is Heroku-ready, thanks to the included `Procfile`.
- To deploy, push to your Heroku remote. Bot should start automatically.
